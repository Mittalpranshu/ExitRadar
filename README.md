# ExitRadar


This project predicts customer churn using machine learning techniques. It uses the Telco Customer Churn dataset and applies data preprocessing, feature engineering, and classification models to identify customers likely to leave a service.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- SMOTE (for class imbalance)
- Random Forest, Logistic Regression, XGBoost

## Key Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Categorical encoding and feature engineering
- SMOTE to handle imbalanced data
- Model training and evaluation (accuracy, F1-score)
- Confusion matrix and classification report

## Results
- Achieved up to **84% accuracy**
- Evaluated models with precision, recall, and F1-score
- Used Random Forest and XGBoost for better results

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Install required libraries
3. Open file in Jupyter or Google Colab
4. Run it.
